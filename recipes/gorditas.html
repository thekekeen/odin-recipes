    <h1>Gorditas</h1>
    <img src="../image.webp">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gorditas are similar to pita pockets but much heartier! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup masa harina (instant corn masa mix)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water</li>
        <li>21 cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the masa harina, salt and hot water. Gradually mix in the shortening and flour. If the dough seems dry, add a little more hot water. Form the dough into balls that will fit into the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Line a work surface with waxed paper or plastic. Sprinkle with water. Flatten balls on the wet surface until about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Cook the gorditas on each side until they are cooked through.

        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat until hot. Fry each gordita until puffed, pressing it down into the oil occasionally with a spatula. Drain briefly on paper towels, cut the tips off and stuff full of your favorite foods.
