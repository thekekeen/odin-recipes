    <h1>Mexican Sushi</h1>
    <img src="../mexican.webp">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This creamy, garlicky, smooth Alfredo sauce is the absolute best. You do not want to use a grated Parmesan that you buy on a shelf. When you cook with that type, your Alfredo goes from a sauce to a gooey mess. You want to buy a very good and very hard Parmesan cheese in triangle form. Also, make sure the cream doesn't boil too much or there will not be enough liquid to make the Alfredo sauce smooth.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces low-fat cream cheese, softened
        </li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons seeded and finely chopped chipotle in adobo</li>
        <li>1 large plain flour tortilla</li>
        <li>1 large tomato-flavored tortilla</li>
        <li>3/4 cup low-fat refried black beans</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons pico de gallo salsa</li>
        <li>1 1/2 medium (blank)s Avocados from Mexico, peeled, pitted and diced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped cilantro leave</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Mix together cream cheese and chipotle. Heat tortillas in microwave or oven to soften. Spread each tortilla with 2 Tbsp. chipotle cream cheese, 1/4 cup black beans and 2 Tbsp. salsa. Scatter one-third of the avocado and cilantro on each.</li>
     <li>Roll up tortillas tightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate. To serve, unwrap and trim ends; cut each roll across into 6 pieces.</li>
    </ol>
